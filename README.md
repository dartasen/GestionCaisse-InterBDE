# GestionCaisseInterBDE

GestionCaisseInterBDE is an WPF/C# application designed to manage the student union's inventory of drinks and snacks when making sales.

## Features

* Keeping track of the inventory and sales (by whom student? how much?...)
* Possibility to have multiple salers (account tracking)
* Ability to create "local accounts" for students that they can refill as they wish

## Requirement

* MySQL engine to store application's data

## Installation

* Database must be initialized first using Mysql Workbench or the installation script inside the *Mysql* folder

## Nota

I created this application to experiment MVVM in my first year of *DUT Informatique*... as a consequence there might be some ugly code inside: don't be too hard on me ^^
